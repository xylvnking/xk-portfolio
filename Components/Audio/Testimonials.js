Hearing his work as a mastering and mix engineer on a variety of multi-genre productions over the years, has only solidified my high regard in his ability to simply elevate a mix when needed- or confidently inject it with some of his own production when called upon. Ambient, trap, folk, indie- he comes to every project with a fresh perspective seeking to serve the art.</p>
                        <p>Having worked with Dylan both as a fellow band member and as an engineer- I can without a doubt recommend his ear and creative intuition to anyone- across genre- looking for someone to mix or master their work."</p>

He was one the first engineers I ever got the chance to give my songs to, so naturally I didn't know what to expect at first. Despite my inexperience, he made me feel comfortable and heard throughout the whole process and it was great hearing the finished product on songs I worked really hard on. He has great knowledge on music direction in general, quick and efficient turnaround times, a great price and an awesome ear for effects. My favourite engineer!"</p>

As someone who thrives creatively but has struggled with technical aspects of production like mixing/mastering, working with Dylan has been a true blessing. He is the only person I trust to mix my music because of his technical expertise and the perspective he brings as an artist himself. What has impressed me the most about Dylanâ€™s work is his ability to understand my concepts and end goals without even expressing them to him. From the moment I send him a new track, he just gets what I am going for and helps me execute it cleanly every time."</p>

                            He takes time efficiency very seriously and will always find a way to ensure your projects move forward at the appropriate speed. As he has taught me over the years, 'mixing is just another level of producing' and that understanding them both can bring your sound to a new level.
